# Serverlist Score

This mod tries to get the best score on the serverlist for you.

The serverlist reduces your points when you server is almost full(80%)
This mod disallows players passing this limit.

How to chose the max_users limit
--------------------------------

Just calculate: maximum_wanted_players/0,8
Don't choose a limit over 200 because this will result in -8 points.
